<h3>Overview</h3>

    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell.

    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>ROOT</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> is ubiquitous in HEP for data analysis and presentation.
      It is available for a variety of operating systems, and is included in the standard repositories
      for many Linux distributions. We will use version 5.34, but newer versions should also be OK.

    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python 2 (version 2.6 or 2.7) since it is still more widely used than Python 3.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      depending on your Linux distribution, but all-in-one installers are available.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this workshop you will need two specialised Python packages:
      <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/pyroot">PyROOT</a> for access to ROOT and 
      <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Nose</a> for unit testing.
      Once you have installed Python and ROOT, check that you have these packages installed by
      trying to import them: type the following at the Python prompt
      <pre>
>>> import ROOT
>>> import nose
      </pre>
      If you see no errors then the packages are installed. If you do see errors, and are
      unable to install these packages, let us know as soon as possible so we can help you
      get set up before the workshop. The installation instructions below are not comprehensive!
